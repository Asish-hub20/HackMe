# 🌐 RAFI (Remote File Inclusion)

## Definition

🔍 Remote File Inclusion (RAFI) exploits scripts to include files located on remote servers, leading to potential security breaches in web applications.

## How It Works

RAFI occurs when an application includes external files or scripts without proper validation. Attackers manipulate these vulnerabilities to execute malicious code or disrupt services. This is typically achieved by altering URL parameters or request data to include remote files.

## Detection

👀 Detecting RAFI involves monitoring for unusual web traffic patterns, such as requests to external domains. Web application firewalls (WAFs) 🔒 and intrusion detection systems (IDS) 🚨 can be configured to detect and alert on potential RAFI patterns.

## Prevention

🛡️ To prevent RAFI:

- Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
- Avoid using user input directly in file inclusion functions.
- Employ server-side input validation.
- Update and patch applications and libraries regularly.

## Example Scenarios

1. **Dynamic Script Inclusion**: Attackers inject a URL pointing to a malicious script into a web application, leading to code execution or data theft.
2. **Data Breach**: RAFI is used to include a file that exfiltrates sensitive data from the server.
3. **Malware Spread**: Through RAFI, malicious files are included, spreading malware to users or other systems.
