# 💉 SQL Injection 

## 📖 Definition 

SQL Injection involves inserting or "injecting" an SQL query via the input data from the client to the application. This can lead to unauthorized access to database information, data manipulation, and other malicious activities.

## 🔄 How It Works 

1. **💻 User Input**: The attacker inputs malicious SQL code into an application's input fields.
2. **🔗 Exploiting Vulnerabilities**: The application, if vulnerable, processes this input as part of an SQL query.
3. **📊 Database Manipulation**: This allows the attacker to manipulate the database, often retrieving, modifying, or deleting data.

## 🔍 Detection 

1. **🔎 Log Analysis**: Regularly review logs for unusual query patterns.
2. **🛡️ Intrusion Detection Systems**: Use systems that can identify SQL injection patterns.
3. **📡 Network Monitoring**: Monitor network traffic for unusual database requests.

## 🛡️ Prevention 

1. **🔐 Use Prepared Statements**: With parameterized queries to prevent injection.
2. **🧱 Employ Web Application Firewalls**: To filter out malicious data.
3. **👩‍💻 Regular Code Reviews**: To identify and fix vulnerabilities.
4. **📚 Educate Developers**: About secure coding practices.

## 🎭 Example Scenarios 

1. **💳 Data Theft**: An attacker retrieves sensitive customer data.
2. **🔓 Unauthorized Access**: Gaining admin access by manipulating login queries.
3. **💥 Data Corruption**: Deleting or altering records through malicious queries.

## 🛠️ How to do it? 

1. **📝 Learn SQL Injection Techniques**:
   - Study different types of SQL injection attacks, such as tautologies, illegal/logically incorrect queries, union queries, and piggybacked queries.
   - Understand the basics of SQL queries and how they can be manipulated.

2. **🧪 Craft and Test Malicious SQL Queries**:
   - Develop SQL queries that exploit known vulnerabilities in SQL databases, like input fields that don’t sanitize user input.
   - Test these queries against your test database to observe how SQL injection can manipulate or retrieve data.
